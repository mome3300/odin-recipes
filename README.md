Odin_Recipes

# Intro

This is my first true HTML test (I feel) where I'm tasked with creating a very basic "recipes" wedsite. I'm expected to apply all that I've learnt so far to complete this project (that is both HTML and Git basics).

# Looking Back

I followed the basic instruction as far as the project is concerned but took some liberties, couldn't be helped!

I had to write this whole README after navigating throught my blunders and taking good care of them, excluding one, 
   where;

      "git add <file>" and "git commit -m" were done per file. Then I felt like changing to "git add ." and "git commit -m".
      
      That's how I learnt the hard way that "adding" files like that (more than 5) meant I'd have one "super commit" for all of them. Realised all this after trying to write a commit for another file where Git returned "nothing to commit...". The supposed "super commit" only read "Edit index.html", nothing more. Ended up pushing it to Github anyway.
