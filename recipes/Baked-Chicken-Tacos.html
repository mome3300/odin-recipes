      <h2>Ingredients and Directions</h2>

      <p>A deliciously spicy, shredded chicken taco filling is whipped up and layered into crispy taco shells with beans, then baked in the oven until hot and tasty. Dinner will be ready in about 25 minutes, and the whole family will be happy!</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Shredded Chicken: Use fully-cooked, shredded chicken for the taco filling. I often use rotisserie chicken for a quick and easy option!</li>

         <li>Taco Seasoning: This blend of spices (chili powder, paprika, garlic and onion powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes) is perfect for any taco recipe.</li>

         <li>Taco Shells: Use hard taco shells. They bake up nice and crispy in the oven!</li>

         <li>Shredded Cheese: Use a Mexican blend shredded cheese, or your favorite variety. Freshly grated cheese gets beautifully melt-y!</li>

         <li>Green Chiles: Use a can of chopped green chiles for the chicken mixture. It adds a little bit of heat and it’s really delicious. Be sure to fully drain them.</li>

         <li>Refried Beans: The creamy texture of refried beans adds a nice layer of texture and flavor beneath the chicken. Use about ½ a can.</li>

         <li>Tomatoes: A can of diced tomatoes adds more texture into the mix. Again, be sure to fully drain these so you don’t end up with too much liquid in the chicken taco filling.</li>

         <li>Onion: Diced onions are sauteed to add more texture and some aromatics. You can use white, sweet, or red onions depending on your flavor preference.</li>

         <li>Toppings: Add jalapeno slices, sour cream, shredded lettuce, Pico de Gallo, cilantro, salsa, taco sauce, or any of your favorite taco toppings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Pro Tip: To keep your chicken tacos crispy when baking, start by baking the shells alone before filling them. I also recommend layering the beans on the bottom when assembling, and placing the chicken filling on top.</p>
